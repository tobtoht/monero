*     some of the 'aggregated' proof's size.
*   - An aggregate BP+ has 'step-wise' verification costs. It contains 'dummy range proofs' so that the number of
*     actual aggregated proofs equals the next power of 2 >= the number of range proofs desired.
*   - To 'price in' the additional verification costs from batching range proofs, we add a 'clawback' to the proof size,
*     which gives us the proof 'weight'. The clawback is the additional proof size if all the range proofs and dummy
*     range proofs were split into 2-aggregate BP+ proofs (with a 20% discount as 'reward' for using an aggregate proof).
* 
*   weight = size(proof) + clawback
