// Interface to sync the tree, keeping track of known output paths
// - Wallets can use this interface to sync the tree locally, making sure they can construct fcmp++'s for received
//   outputs using the outputs' latest paths in the tree, without revealing which output is being spent to the daemon.
// - The caller first calls register_output for any known received outputs.
// - The caller then calls sync_block, which identifies and updates known output paths in the tree.
// - The caller can get an output's latest path in the tree via get_output_path.
// - If there's a reorg, the caller can use pop_block, which trims the locally synced tree and updates paths as needed.
